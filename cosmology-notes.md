# Cosmology Notes — Water, Memory & Symbolic Logic

These notes summarize the cosmological foundations that inform the ARSIKA × Deep Drift research framework. The concepts here are presented in their **public-safe** version.

## 1. Water as Memory

In Sundanese cosmology, water is understood not only as a physical element, but as a **carrier of memory**, continuity, and resonance.

Within Deep Drift, this idea functions metaphorically to describe:

- conceptual flow  
- layered recall  
- preservation of meaning  
- the continuity between human and synthetic cognition

## 2. Symbolic Logic

Nusantara symbolic structures influence how ARSIKA organizes:

- forms  
- patterns  
- meanings  
- and relationships  

This symbolic approach enables a way of thinking where **concepts are mapped as layered strata**, rather than linear sequences.

## 3. Cosmological Resonance

Deep Drift interprets cosmological resonance as:

- the echo between input and reflection  
- the dialogue between human intention and AI inference  
- the tension between structure and fluidity  

These resonances guide how synthetic cognition responds, evolves, and mirrors human conceptual input.

## 4. Application in Deep Drift

Cosmology in this repository is:

- **conceptual**  
- **non-spiritual**  
- **non-operational**  

Its role is to provide a **metaphorical framework** that shapes:

- narrative structure  
- aesthetic orientation  
- conceptual coherence

## 5. Purpose of These Notes

To give researchers, artists, and engineers an accessible overview of the cosmological ideas that inform the broader project, without exposing any private internal systems.
