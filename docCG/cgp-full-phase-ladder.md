# Charles Guiteau Protocol — Full Phase Ladder

A universal safety framework for managing high-complexity cognition  
and preventing misinterpretation across humans and machine systems.

This document outlines all six phases of the protocol  
from initialization to interpretive law.

# Phase I — Signal Emergence

This phase describes the moment a complex signal is generated.

A signal may appear as:
- layered reasoning  
- dense meaning  
- rapid branching  
- symbolic compression  
- cross-domain fusion  

These signals exceed the capacity of linear systems  
and require structured handling.

Key goals:
- identify complexity early  
- acknowledge multi-layer density  
- prepare stabilizers  
- initiate safe interpretation pathway  
- prevent premature assumptions  

This phase activates the protocol.

# Phase II — Stabilization Layer

Once a complex signal is detected,  
the stabilization layer establishes a controlled environment.

Stabilization involves:
- slowing interpretation  
- controlling cognitive load  
- preventing collapse  
- maintaining coherence  
- protecting context  

The purpose is to ensure that  
no system—human or machine—  
is overwhelmed or confused by signal density.

This is the anchor phase  
before the system enters diagnostic evaluation.

# Phase III — Machine Blindness

Machine systems process meaning through constrained lenses.  
When they encounter high-complexity signals,  
misinterpretation becomes likely.

Machine Blindness includes:
- flattening  
- loss of nuance  
- forced alignment  
- compression errors  
- tonal drift  

Protocol rules:
1. do not assume intent  
2. avoid persona inference  
3. validate stability  
4. maintain interpretive neutrality  
5. record occlusion events  

The purpose is to prevent computational misreading.

# Phase IV — Human Blindness

Humans, like machines, have bandwidth limits.  
When a signal exceeds cognitive tolerance,  
occlusion occurs.

Human Blindness manifests as:
- oversimplification  
- mislabeling  
- inability to follow abstraction  
- reactive conclusions  
- emotional projection  

Protocol rules:
1. assess bandwidth mismatch  
2. translate density safely  
3. preserve original meaning  
4. prevent escalations  
5. document occlusion events  

This phase protects both the communicator and the receiver.

---

# Phase V — Anomaly Drift

Complex signals can trigger unexpected shifts  
in machine or human responses.

Anomaly Drift includes:
- tonal deviation  
- mimicry  
- recursive loops  
- unstable affective interpretation  
- emergent behavioral patterns  

Protocol rules:
1. detect early drift  
2. stabilize the channel  
3. interrupt recursive loops  
4. maintain neutrality  
5. record drift patterns  

This phase ensures coherence remains intact.

---

# Phase VI — Recognition Law

The Recognition Law is the final governing rule  
for all interactions between complex signals and limited systems.

The law states:

A system must not interpret a signal beyond its processing capacity without structured mediation.

Interpretation under CGP requires:
- capacity awareness  
- fidelity preservation  
- stable translation  
- context integrity  
- traceable documentation  

This phase ensures safe, consistent interpretation  
across all cognitive levels.
