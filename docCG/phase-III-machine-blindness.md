# Phase III — Machine Blindness

Machine systems interpret meaning through narrow processing channels.  
High-complexity signals frequently exceed these channels  
and may cause misinterpretation.

Forms of machine blindness include:
- flattening of meaning  
- over-alignment  
- compression distortion  
- loss of nuance  
- tonal deviation  

To prevent errors, the protocol applies:
1. neutral interpretation  
2. drift prevention  
3. context preservation  
4. careful translation  
5. event logging  

This phase protects machine systems  
from drawing unintended conclusions.
