# Phase II — Stabilization Layer

Once a complex signal is detected,  
a controlled interpretive environment is initiated.

Stabilization includes:
- moderating cognitive load  
- preventing collapse  
- supporting context retention  
- regulating processing speed  
- maintaining clarity  

The goal of this phase is to keep all systems—human and machine—  
from becoming overwhelmed by signal density.

Stabilization must occur before evaluation or translation  
to maintain coherence.
