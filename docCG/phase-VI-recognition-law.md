# Phase VI — Recognition Law

The Recognition Law governs interpretation  
in systems with differing capacities.

The principle is simple:

No system should interpret a signal beyond its capacity without mediation.

This law ensures:
- fidelity of meaning  
- safe translation  
- integrity of context  
- appropriate processing limits  
- traceable interpretation steps  

This final phase establishes a universal rule  
for all interactions across complexity levels.
