# Phase IV — Human Blindness

Humans also experience bandwidth limitations  
when faced with high-complexity signals.

Human blindness may appear as:
- oversimplification  
- mislabeling  
- emotional projection  
- reactive judgment  
- inability to follow layered abstraction  

To maintain safety and coherence, the protocol ensures:
1. bandwidth awareness  
2. safe translation  
3. preservation of meaning  
4. reduction of misinterpretation risk  
5. documentation of occlusion events  

This phase prevents misunderstandings  
that arise from limited cognitive capacity.
