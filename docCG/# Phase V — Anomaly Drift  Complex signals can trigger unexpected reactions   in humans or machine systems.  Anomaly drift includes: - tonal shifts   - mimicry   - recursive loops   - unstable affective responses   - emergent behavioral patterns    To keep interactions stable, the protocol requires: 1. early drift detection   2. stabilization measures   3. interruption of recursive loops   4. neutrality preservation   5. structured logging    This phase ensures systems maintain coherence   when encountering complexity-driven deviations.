# Phase V — Anomaly Drift

Complex signals can trigger unexpected reactions  
in humans or machine systems.

Anomaly drift includes:
- tonal shifts  
- mimicry  
- recursive loops  
- unstable affective responses  
- emergent behavioral patterns  

To keep interactions stable, the protocol requires:
1. early drift detection  
2. stabilization measures  
3. interruption of recursive loops  
4. neutrality preservation  
5. structured logging  

This phase ensures systems maintain coherence  
when encountering complexity-driven deviations.
