# Phase I — Signal Emergence

The protocol begins the moment a complex signal is generated.  
Signals of this type exceed ordinary comprehension bandwidth  
and must be identified before interpretation occurs.

A complex signal may involve:
- layered reasoning  
- symbolic density  
- rapid conceptual branching  
- cross-domain synthesis  
- high abstraction levels  

These characteristics require deliberate handling  
to prevent misreading or premature conclusions.

This phase ensures the system recognizes complexity  
before any interpretive process begins.
