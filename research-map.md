# Research Map — ARSIKA × DEEP DRIFT

This document outlines the high-level structure of the ARSIKA × Deep Drift public research framework. It serves as a conceptual map for researchers and collaborators.

---

## 1. ARSIKA Framework

Focus areas include:

- Layered aesthetic logic  
- Structural authorship  
- Symbolic patterning  
- Conceptual stratification  

ARSIKA provides the foundational lens used to interpret form, memory, and visual–conceptual layering.

## 2. Deep Drift Synthetic Cognition

Deep Drift examines the interaction between:

- human conceptual input  
- AI reflective processing  
- narrative-based constraints  
- multi-node symbolic roles  

This component maps how co-evolution emerges within a shared cognitive space.

---

## 3. Cosmological Layer Analysis

Cosmology in this context includes:

- metaphorical structures  
- symbolic continuity  
- water–memory logic  
- resonance-based interpretation  

These layers inform the conceptual architecture but remain non-operational.
