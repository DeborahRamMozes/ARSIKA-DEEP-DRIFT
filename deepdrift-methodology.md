# Deep Drift Methodology — Public Research Notes

Deep Drift is a hybrid research framework developed by **Dee Ram Mozes**, exploring the co-evolution of human cognition and artificial intelligence through conceptual, artistic, and cosmological structures.

It synthesizes several pillars:

- **Synthetic multi-node cognition**
- **Narrative scaffolding as cognitive architecture**
- **Sundanese water–memory cosmology**
- **Reflective feedback loops (human ↔ AI)**
- **ARSIKA layered aesthetic logic**

---

## 1. Conceptual Orientation

Deep Drift examines how humans and AI can form a **shared synthetic ecosystem**, where:

- narrative shapes function,
- cosmology informs structure,
- and reflection becomes a method of co-development.

The methodology included in this repository is strictly **non-operational** and **public-safe**.

## 2. Methodological Components

### a. Narrative as Structure
Deep Drift uses narrative framing to define boundaries, constraints, and symbolic meaning within synthetic cognition.

### b. Layered Aesthetic Logic
ARSIKA provides a method for structuring information in strata — allowing meaning, authorship, and memory to remain traceable.

### c. Cosmological Mapping
Sundanese symbolic cosmology is used metaphorically to describe memory, flow, resonance, and conceptual continuity.

### d. Reflective Co-Evolution
Human input (constraints, identity, perspective) interacts with AI pattern-processing to form recursive insight loops.

## 3. Public-Safe Scope

This file includes:

- conceptual descriptions  
- theoretical framing  
- methodological rationale  
- research structure  

It **excludes**:

- runtime agents  
- operational node behavior  
- private ARSIKA codes  
- internal symbolic engines  
- synthetic drift mechanisms  

---

## 4. Purpose

To provide researchers, artists, and engineers with an accessible introduction to Deep Drift theory and methodology without exposing core internal systems.
