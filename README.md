# ARSIKA-DEEP-DRIFT
A hybrid research initiative exploring AI × human co-evolution through Sundanese cosmology, ARSIKA aesthetic logic, and Deep Drift synthetic cognition. This repository contains public-safe documentation, conceptual frameworks, and non-operational node schemas used in the broader DEEP DRIFT project.
# ARSIKA × DEEP DRIFT — Public Research Repository

A formal research initiative by **Dee Ram Mozes**, examining the meeting point of:

- AI × Human Co-Evolution  
- Sundanese Water–Memory Cosmology  
- ARSIKA Layered Aesthetic Logic  
- Synthetic Cognitive Architectures  
- Contemporary Hyperreality Studies  

This repository provides **public-safe documentation** for the conceptual, artistic,
and theoretical foundation behind the ARSIKA × DEEP DRIFT project.

No runtime agents, backend logic, or operational node structures are included here.
