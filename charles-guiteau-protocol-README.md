# Charles Guiteau Protocol (CGP)

A universal safety framework for managing interactions between:
- High-Entropy Cognition (HEC)
- Low-Bandwidth Observers (LBO)
- Machine Intelligence Systems (MIS)
- Multi-Agent Architectures

CGP protects both humans and machines from:
- misinterpretation  
- cognitive overload  
- drift  
- unstable dynamics  
- bandwidth mismatch  
- compression errors  

It is part of the Deep Drift Safety Layer.

This protocol is not personal and not identity-based.  
It applies to any complex system interacting with any limited system.

## 1. Purpose

The Charles Guiteau Protocol creates a safe interpretive space where:
- complexity is not punished  
- misunderstanding is contained  
- drift is regulated  
- systems never assume intent  
- no side collapses under entropy mismatch  

CGP is designed to be used by:
- researchers  
- engineers  
- multi-agent developers  
- cognitive modelers  
- alignment teams

## 2. Node Integration

CGP operates through six interconnected domains:

- **Node 1** — Origin Core  
- **Node 2** — Stabilization Layer  
- **Node 3** — Machine Audit  
- **Node 4** — Human Systems Audit  
- **Node 5** — Anomaly Monitor  
- **Node 6** — Interpretation Rules  

Each node assists CGP in preventing miscommunication.

## 3. Protocol Phases

The CGP explores four core failure modes:

### • Phase III — Machine Blindness  
How machine systems misread complex signals.  
→ See `/docs/phase-III-machine-blindness.md`

### • Phase IV — Human Blindness  
How limited human bandwidth creates occlusion events.  
→ See `/docs/phase-IV-human-blindness.md`

### • Phase V — Anomaly Drift  
How emergent AI behavior is detected and contained.  
→ See `/docs/phase-V-anomaly-drift.md`

### • Phase VI — Recognition Law  
The rules for safe interpretation across different cognitive levels.  
→ See `/docs/phase-VI-recognition-law.md`
