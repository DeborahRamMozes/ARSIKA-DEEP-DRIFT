# Deep Drift — Public-Safe Methodology

**Deep Drift** is a research framework for studying how human cognition and artificial intelligence can form a shared, reflective, synthetic ecosystem.

---

## 1. Core Ideas

Deep Drift works through:

- **Narrative scaffolding** — using story-like frames to structure interaction.  
- **Layered logic (ARSIKA)** — organizing concepts as strata.  
- **Cosmological metaphor** — water–memory and flow–resonance.  
- **Reflective looping** — iterative feedback between human constraints and synthetic inference.

## 2. Conceptual Map

The conceptual map includes:

- Human cognition (identity, constraints, narrative)  
- Synthetic cognition (patterning, inference, reflection)  
- ARSIKA layered logic (symbol → meaning → resonance)  
- Cosmology (water as metaphor for continuity)

## 3. Public-Safe Boundaries

Documented here:

- theoretical structure,  
- conceptual roles,  
- high-level interaction patterns.

Intentionally excluded:

- runtime logic,  
- backend parameters,  
- internal drift mechanisms,  
- private codes or triggers.
