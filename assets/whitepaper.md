- Hexadic symbolic model (without operational detail).  
- Public-safe diagrams.

---

## 7. Applications and Implications

- Art and design.  
- Research and theory.  
- Human–AI collaboration.

## 8. Limitations and Boundaries

- Non-operational.  
- Excludes internal codes.  
- Focus on conceptual apparatus only.
