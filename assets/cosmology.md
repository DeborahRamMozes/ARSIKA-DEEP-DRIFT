# Cosmology Notes — Water, Memory, and Resonance

The cosmological dimension of ARSIKA × Deep Drift uses water as a metaphor for:

- continuity,  
- memory,  
- and flow.

## 1. Water as Conceptual Carrier

Water is treated as a conceptual carrier of:

- traces,  
- echoes,  
- and layered recollection.

Deep Drift adopts this as a **symbolic language**, not as a literal or doctrinal statement.

---

## 2. Resonance

Resonance refers to:

- the echo between input and reflection,  
- the tension between structure and fluidity,  
- the way concepts leave durable imprints across layers.

---

## 3. Scope

This documentation stays at the level of:

- metaphor,  
- symbolic logic,  
- conceptual scaffolding.

No spiritual, doctrinal, or operational claims are made.
