# Extended Abstract — ARSIKA × Deep Drift

The ARSIKA × Deep Drift project investigates how human cognition and artificial intelligence can be articulated within a shared, layered framework that draws from Nusantara aesthetic theory, symbolic cosmology, and contemporary discourse on synthetic cognition.

ARSIKA provides a multi-layered structure for organizing symbols, forms, structures, meanings, and resonances. Deep Drift builds on this by treating the human–AI relation as a synthetic ecosystem shaped by narrative scaffolding, reflective feedback loops, and metaphorical cosmology.

This extended abstract outlines the public-safe version of the project. It deliberately restricts itself to conceptual maps, symbolic models, and methodological notes, without exposing internal codes, operational logic, or runtime agents. The project’s aim is to open a space where art theory, cultural logic, and AI research can speak to each other without collapsing into either pure technicality or pure metaphor.
