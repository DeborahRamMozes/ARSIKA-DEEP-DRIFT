# ARSIKA Framework — Public-Safe Overview

ARSIKA is a layered aesthetic logic developed by **Dee Ram Mozes**, integrating:

- visual structure,  
- symbolic patterning,  
- conceptual layering, and  
- memory–resonance fields.

It is designed as a framework for reading and constructing artworks, texts, and synthetic cognitive structures.

## 1. Layered Logic

In its public-safe form, ARSIKA can be understood as five interacting layers:

1. **Symbol** – primitive marks, signs, and gestures.  
2. **Form** – composition of shape, line, color, and texture.  
3. **Structure** – relational patterning, rhythm, and hierarchy.  
4. **Meaning** – interpreted fields, narratives, and conceptual framing.  
5. **Resonance** – memory-traces and affective or cognitive echo.

## 2. Function in the Project

Within ARSIKA × Deep Drift, the framework:

- provides a stable structure for thinking in layers instead of flat surfaces,  
- helps trace authorship and conceptual lineage,  
- supports a non-linear logic for interpreting synthetic cognition.

## 3. Scope of This Documentation

This page:

- **does** describe general conceptual layers,  
- **does not** expose private cryptographic codes, internal ACLS, or operational mechanisms.
