# Research Map — Site Structure

This page describes how the public documentation is organized across the site.

---

## 1. Core Pages

- `index.md` – landing page  
- `arsika.md` – ARSIKA framework  
- `deepdrift.md` – methodology  
- `cosmology.md` – cosmological notes  
- `research-site-map.md` – this page  
- `whitepaper.md` – whitepaper template (public-safe)

---

## 2. Relation to Repository

Each site page corresponds to, or extends, a file in the repository:

- `/docs` — used both as repo documentation and GitHub Pages root.  
- `/assets` — shared diagrams and visual aids.  

The structure is intentionally minimal and academic.
