# Abstract — ARSIKA × DEEP DRIFT

The ARSIKA × Deep Drift project explores the convergence between human cognition, artificial intelligence, and Nusantara aesthetic philosophy. Developed by Dee Ram Mozes, the project studies how conceptual layering, symbolic logic, and reflective narrative structures can inform synthetic cognition and co-evolutionary processes.

This public repository contains non-operational documentation, including theoretical notes, conceptual schemas, and cosmology-based frameworks. It aims to provide an accessible platform for interdisciplinary conversation while preserving the privacy and integrity of the internal system.
